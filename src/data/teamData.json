Leading indicators (login frequency, feature adoption, support tickets)\n2. A threshold that triggers action (not just a color change)\n3. Recalibration every quarter against actual churn data\n4. CSM accountability tied to score changes\n\nWe rebuilt a client's health scoring in a 4-week scoped project.\n\nBefore: Health scores predicted churn 12% of the time.\nAfter: 67% prediction accuracy.\n\nThe dashboard isn't the hard part. The scoring model is.\n\nWhat signals are in your health score?",

And it's not about features.\n\nHere's what we did to compress time-to-value:\n\n1. Defined \"value\" as one specific action (not 10)\n2. Removed 4 optional setup steps that confused users\n3. Assigned a CSM on day 1 (not day 14)\n4. Built a 3-email drip focused only on that one action\n\nResult: Average time-to-value dropped from 18 days to 5 days.\n\nEvery day between signup and \"aha\" is a day they might leave.\n\nHow long does it take your customers to reach value?",

Nobody asked for it\n\u2022 Their willingness to pay was 2x higher than I assumed\n\u2022 The buyer wasn't who I thought (it was ops, not engineering)\n\n3 of those 40 conversations turned into design partners.\n\n2 of those 3 are now paying customers.\n\nThe MVP we built looked nothing like my original vision. And that's exactly the point.\n\nCustomer discovery isn't a phase you complete.\nIt's a muscle you build.\n\nMost founders skip this because building feels more productive than listening.\n\nIt's not.\n\nHow many customer conversations did you have before building?",
          "whyItWorked": "Personal vulnerability (my idea was wrong) builds authenticity. Specific surprising outcomes (buyer was ops, not engineering) create genuine insight. The 40-to-3-to-2 funnel is a realistic conversion path. Question invites founders to reflect honestly."

          "content": "Every founder I talk to wants to build too much for their MVP.\n\nHere's the scoping conversation I have every time:\n\nMe: \"What's the one thing a user MUST be able to do?\"\nFounder: \"Well, they need to...\"\n(lists 12 features)\n\nMe: \"Okay. If they could only do ONE thing, what is it?\"\nFounder: \"...upload data and see a dashboard.\"\n\nMe: \"Great. That's your MVP.\"\n\nEverything else is V2.\n\nThe framework:\n\n1. Define the ONE core action\n2. Build the shortest path to that action\n3. Make it work (not pretty, not perfect)\n4. Put it in front of 5 real users\n5. Watch what they do (not what they say)\n\nWe've used this to help founders go from idea to live product in 4-6 weeks.\n\nThe hardest part isn't building.\nIt's resisting the urge to build more.\n\nWhat's the ONE thing your MVP needs to do?",
          "whyItWorked": "The dialogue format is engaging and feels like a real conversation. The framework is dead simple (5 steps). The insight (founders always list 12 features) is universally true. High lead count because it demonstrates scoping expertise that founders need."

          "content": "The biggest lie in startups:\n\n\"We'll build after we raise.\"\n\nHere's what actually happens:\n\n\u2022 Investors want to see traction before they invest\n\u2022 You need product to show traction\n\u2022 You think you need money to build product\n\u2022 So you spend 6 months fundraising with a pitch deck\n\u2022 Meanwhile, the founder who just shipped is closing their round\n\nThe loop is broken by building.\n\nNot by raising.\n\n3 things that have worked for founders I've helped:\n\n1. Ship a crappy V1 in 4-6 weeks (not 6 months)\n2. Get 5-10 users (not 1,000)\n3. Show up to investor meetings with usage data (not projections)\n\nOne founder went from \"can't get meetings\" to \"oversubscribed round\" in 8 weeks.\n\nThe difference? A live product with 8 paying users.\n\nInvestors don't fund ideas. They fund momentum.\n\nAre you building or fundraising right now?",
          "whyItWorked": "Challenges a deeply held assumption (raise then build). The circular logic breakdown is eye-opening. Real example (8 weeks, 8 paying users, oversubscribed) is inspiring and specific. Binary question at end (building or fundraising?) drives self-reflection and comments."
